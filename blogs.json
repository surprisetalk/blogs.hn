I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in computer science from Brigham Young University in April 2022. I am interested in researching and designing better programming languages. Programming languages are our interface to computation, and different programming languages shape how we think about solving problems with computation. I have done research around compilers and static analysis, and going forward I will be working on novel type systems to catch new kinds of errors and to make programming more intuitive for beginners.",

That usually involves going through thousands of articles, posts, tweets, videos, facts, and trivia and choosing a few dozens of the best ones, and then condensing them to a quote or two with some customary commentary.   Books I read and things I cook come as a bonus."
